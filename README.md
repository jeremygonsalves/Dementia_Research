The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that assesses the overall brain health of clients aged 30 to 75. With the global rise in dementia, currently affecting 1 in 3 individuals, this project aligns with the objectives of Honsberger Physiotherapy to predict brain health scores through a series of comprehensive tests.

This initiative is not designed as a preventive tool but rather as a guide to help identify individuals who may be at higher risk of cognitive decline, providing valuable insights into their brain health status.
